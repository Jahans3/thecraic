# The Craic

In this day and age we barely interact with our fellow human beings, office communication in particular fetishizes productivity and efficiency at the expense everything else, but we can do more.

We have minimal contact time with our fellow workers -  using Slack to talk to co-workers and stand up to rapidly communicate our work objectives, but what if we could do more, what if we never had to lay our eyes upon the miserable sacks of meat we call our co-workers ever again?

Introducing The Craicâ„¢, a Twitter-esque office communication app that allows workers to stay on top of what their coworkers are doing from the comfort of your own desk. Never use those loathesome, inefficient legs of yours ever again!

## What's the crack?

Use with Slack and Screenhero and you'll never have to go within 15 feet of your co-workers ever again! Hurrah!
